# Client-Server Chat and Game

### Overview
This command line-based program hosts a simple chat room between a client and a server program. On top of the chat room, there is a game of hangman built within the chat function that the client can initiate at any time and the server will host the game.

## How to Use
This should be run in integrated terminals, one for client.py and one for server.py, so the programs can enter a chat room together. The client and server can send messages back and forth and the server can host a game of hangman for the client. Either side can exit the chat room or game at any time by typing '\q'.
